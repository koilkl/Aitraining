# Usage & Packaging (macOS .dmg / Windows .exe)

Goal: students should not need to install Python. Double-click to launch.

## How to Use (Students / Teachers)

- Typical workflow:
  - Home → `New Project` → `Image`
  - Choose a start mode:
    - `Start from empty`: create classes and collect samples from scratch
    - `Start from classified class`: import a dataset that is already grouped by label
    - `Open .tmproj`: restore a previously saved project archive
- Workspace navigation:
  - Open the top-left `Teachable Machine` menu for `Open project`, `Save project`, `Return`, and `Reset project`
  - `Return` goes back to the page you came from:
    - empty project workspace → home
    - classified import workspace → classified import page
    - opened `.tmproj` workspace → home
  - `Reset project` clears the current workspace session
- Classes and samples:
  - `＋ Add a class`: add a new class card
  - Click the class name to rename it
  - Each class card supports `Webcam`, `Upload`, and `Device`
  - `Webcam` and `Upload` samples are shown in color in the UI when available
  - `Device` samples are grayscale frames from a serial/UART source
  - Training input is normalized to grayscale for all sample sources, so webcam/upload/device are trained consistently
- Device source:
      - Open the `Device` card and use the `⚙` settings panel to configure `Image Size`, `Color Mode`, `Baud Rate`, and `Sync Header`
      - `Image Size` selects the frame resolution sent by the firmware: 96×96, 160×160, or 384×384 — must match the firmware output exactly
      - `Color Mode` selects Grayscale (1 channel) or RGB (3 channels) depending on the firmware sketch
      - `Sync Header` is the hex frame marker used to detect the start of each image packet, for example `AA 55 AA`
      - Change the sync value if your firmware uses a different frame prefix
- Classified import:
  - `Browse...` opens the system folder picker
  - `Load folder` stays disabled until a folder path is present
  - Supported input layouts are documented below in `Dataset Folder Structure`
  - Imported class names come from folder / label names
- Training:
  - The middle `Training` panel trains an int8 TFLite model from the current workspace
  - The `Advanced` section exposes all model hyperparameters: `Image Size` (model input resolution), batch size, epochs, learning rate, conv/dense layer sizes
  - `Image Size` controls the resolution images are resized to before training — all samples are preprocessed to this size regardless of their original dimensions
  - Image preprocessing is configured per class from the preprocess button shown next to each class name
  - The class preprocess `Processed Preview` shows the thresholded mask — white = filtered out (background), dark = candidate sign pixels.  Tune the `Dark Thresh` and `Lum Thresh` sliders in the edit page to adjust what the detector keeps
  - Each class preprocess page supports:
    - `Manual ROI`: draw a custom ROI directly on a sample image for that class
    - `Full Frame`: disable extra ROI cropping for that class
- Preview / Export:
      - The right `Preview` panel runs preview inference after training
      - Toggle `Input` to start/stop live predictions; toggle `ROI` to switch between raw input and the thresholded mask view (shows dark/lum effects)
      - The slider bar under the preview image provides live `Dark Thresh` and `Lum Thresh` controls — adjust them to tune sign detection while watching the ROI view
      - `Export Model` writes model files and MCU helper files to the selected export folder
- Default output directories:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/TFLiteTraining/`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\TFLiteTraining\\`
  - Structure:
    - `workspace/`: current project workspace
    - `datasets/`: training datasets (images grouped by class)
    - `runs/`: training runs and artifacts from each Train (e.g. .keras/.tflite/labels)
    - `logs/streamlit.log`: app logs (for debugging)
- Export to MCU:
  - `model.h / model.cpp`: drop into Arduino/ESP-IDF projects (array name can be set in Export)
  - `labels.txt`: class order (inference index mapping)

## Quick Start Demo (10 minutes)

A step-by-step walkthrough that showcases every major feature.  Ideal for presentations and first-time users.

---

### Step 1 — Create a Project (30 sec)

1. Launch the app → you see the **Home** screen.
2. Click **Open Image Project** → **Start from empty**.
3. You are now in the workspace with three columns: **Classes**, **Training**, **Preview**.

---

### Step 2 — Add Classes (30 sec)

1. In the left column, click **＋ Add a class** to create a second class.
2. Click a class name to rename it (e.g. `SIGN`, `BACKGROUND`).
3. Each class card has three capture buttons: **Webcam**, **Device**, **Upload**.

> **Demo tip**: Create 2 classes — one for the sign, one for background/nothing.

---

### Step 3 — Configure Device Source (1 min)

1. On a class card, click **Device** to open the device panel.
2. Click the **⚙ gear icon** on the device panel to open settings:

   | Setting | Value | What it does |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Image Size** | 96 / 160 / 384 | Must match your firmware output |
   | **Color Mode** | Grayscale / RGB | Grayscale for inference, RGB for data collection |
   | **Baud Rate** | 921600 | Match your serial port speed |
   | **Sync Header** | AA 55 AA | Frame start marker |

3. Click **Apply** — the device preview should show live frames.

> **Showcase**: Change Image Size and see the preview adapt.  This proves the app handles any resolution.

---

### Step 4 — Capture Samples (2 min)

1. Click and **hold** the device/webcam capture button → samples are saved to that class.
2. Repeat for each class.  Aim for 10-20 samples per class.
3. The sample count updates on each class card.

> **Showcase**: The device works with **any frame size** (96/160/384) and **Grayscale or RGB** — configured entirely from the gear icon, no code changes.

---

### Step 5 — Tune Detection Thresholds (2 min) ⭐ KEY FEATURE

1. Click the **preprocess button** (🔍 icon) next to a class name.
2. The class edit page opens showing your samples on the left and a **Processed Preview** on the right.
3. The preview shows the **thresholded mask** — white = filtered out, dark = what the detector keeps.
4. Adjust the **Dark Thr** and **Lum Thr** sliders:

   | Slider | Default | Effect |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Dark Thr** | 0 | Pixels darker than this → ignored as shadow |
   | **Lum Thr** | 100 | Pixels brighter than this → ignored as background |

5. Watch the processed preview update in real-time as you drag the sliders.
6. The ROI bounding box (green outline) shows where the detector found the sign.

> **Showcase**: This is the core tuning workflow.  The processed preview gives instant visual feedback — no guesswork.

---

### Step 6 — Train the Model (1 min)

1. In the middle **Training** column, click **Train Model**.
2. To change model parameters, expand **Advanced**:

   | Parameter | Default | What it does |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Image Size** | 96 | All images resized to this before training |
   | **Batch Size** | 32 | Samples per training step |
   | **Epochs** | 20 | Training iterations |
   | **Learning Rate** | 0.0016 | Optimization step size |

3. Training takes 10-60 seconds.  A progress bar shows status.

> **Showcase**: The **Image Size** parameter is independent of capture resolution.  You can capture at 160×160 but train at 96×96 (or vice versa).

---

### Step 7 — Preview & Tune Live (2 min) ⭐ KEY FEATURE

1. After training, the right **Preview** panel becomes active.
2. Toggle **Input ON** → live camera feed with predictions.
3. Toggle **ROI ON** → switches to the **thresholded mask view**.
4. Use the **slider bar** under the preview image:

   ```
   Dark [===○========] 3    Lum [========○===] 76
   ```

5. Adjust sliders while watching the ROI view — the detection updates in real-time.

> **Showcase**: The slider bar + ROI toggle is the fastest way to find good thresholds.  No need to re-train — just slide and see.

---

### Step 8 — Save & Export (30 sec)

1. Click the **top-left menu** → **Save project** → saves a `.tmproj` file.
2. All settings are preserved: class names, samples, thresholds, training config.
3. Click **Export Model** → choose a folder → gets `.tflite`, `model.cpp`, `model.h`, `labels.txt`.

> **Showcase**: `.tmproj` is a complete snapshot.  Share it with teammates or reopen it later — everything is restored.

## ROI Detection Pipeline

The auto-crop uses a G-channel dark-object + edge detection algorithm to find signs:

1. **G-channel extraction**: green channel has best SNR in typical lighting
2. **Dark/Lum thresholding**: pixels with G between `Dark Thresh` (default 0) and `Lum Thresh` (default 100) are sign candidates; everything else → white
3. **Search window**: looks for the sign within x:10-90%, y:10-90% of the frame
4. **Edge detection**: within the search window, dark pixels near edges score higher
5. **Blob scoring**: best blob by weighted-sum × aspect-ratio × area × center-prior
6. **Crop**: from the original RGB using the detected bbox → BT.601 luminance → resize → contrast stretch

If no sign is found: center crop fallback (50%, 50% position, 40% side).

The **processed preview** (ROI toggle / class edit page) shows step 2: white = filtered out, dark = candidate pixels.  Tune Dark/Lum thresholds in the slider bar to adjust what the detector considers a sign.

## Export Behavior

- Export directory selection:
  - The app asks for an export folder from the workspace export entry points
  - The selected folder is reused as the last export location
- Overwrite behavior:
  - If export targets already exist, the app shows a confirmation dialog before overwriting
  - Cancel keeps the existing files unchanged
  - Confirm overwrites the existing export files in place
- Exported files:
  - Named model files:
    - `<export name>.tflite`
    - `<export name>_model_data.h`
    - `<export name>_model_data.cpp`
    - `model_settings.h`
    - `model_settings.cpp`
  - Compatibility files:
    - `model.h`
    - `model.cpp`
    - `labels.txt`
- Export naming:
  - `Export name` controls the `.tflite` base name and the generated `*_model_data.*` file names
  - `Array name` controls the C/C++ tensor array symbol used inside generated source files

## Dataset Folder Structure

- The app reads classified datasets where each label maps to one class folder.
- Supported layouts:
  - `label/image`
  - `train/label/image` together with optional `val/label/image` and `test/label/image`
- Typical examples:

```text
dataset/
├── cat/
│   ├── 0001.jpg
│   ├── 0002.png
│   └── ...
├── dog/
│   ├── 0001.jpg
│   ├── 0002.png
│   └── ...
├── labels.txt
└── labels.json
```

```text
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── cat/
│   │   ├── a.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   └── dog/
│       ├── b.jpg
│       └── ...
├── val/
│   ├── cat/
│   └── dog/
└── test/
    ├── cat/
    └── dog/
```

- Notes:
  - `label` becomes the class name in the workspace.
  - Supported image extensions are `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `bmp`, `webp`, and `gif`.
  - Imported webcam/upload samples may be stored as color images for display, but training is loaded as grayscale.
  - Device samples are grayscale.
  - Serial device frames use a sync header before the payload (96×96, 160×160, or 384×384, Grayscale or RGB, configurable in device settings). The default sync header is `AA 55 AA`, and it can be changed from the device settings gear if your firmware uses a different frame prefix.
  - If the selected folder does not contain a supported classified dataset layout, the import page reports that no dataset was detected.

## `.tmproj` File Structure

- `.tmproj` is a zip-based project archive used by `Save project` / `Open project`.
- It stores project state, samples, labels, and optional training artifacts.
- Typical structure:

```text
project.tmproj
├── manifest.json
├── tm_classes.json
├── tm_train_latest.json
├── dataset/
│   ├── labels.txt
│   ├── labels.json
│   ├── Class 1/
│   │   ├── 8d3c....png
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Class 2/
│   │   ├── 2a71....jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── runs/
    └── latest/
        ├── model.keras
        ├── model.tflite
        ├── labels.txt
        └── ...
```

- Main files:
  - `manifest.json`: archive format/version and internal paths such as `dataset/` and `runs/latest/`
  - `tm_classes.json`: current class order plus per-class preprocess settings used by the workspace UI
  - `tm_train_latest.json`: latest trained model metadata and export references
  - `dataset/`: samples saved in dataset format, grouped by class
  - `processed_cache/`: cached processed previews regenerated from the current preprocess settings when available
  - `dataset/labels.txt` and `dataset/labels.json`: label list stored with the samples
  - `runs/latest/`: latest training outputs, included only when a trained run exists

- Compatibility notes:
  - `Open project` restores from the packaged `dataset/` directory.
  - If `tm_classes.json` is missing, the app can fall back to `dataset/labels.json` or `dataset/labels.txt`.
  - `.tmproj` should be treated as an app project archive, not as a generic dataset export.
  - `Save project` preserves the dataset-style sample layout so the archive can reopen with the same classes and samples.

## FAQ

- macOS “App can’t be opened / unidentified developer”: right-click `TFLiteTraining.app` → Open → Confirm, or allow it in System Settings.
- macOS first-time webcam access: the app will trigger the system camera permission prompt. If you previously denied, re-enable it in “System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera” for `TFLiteTraining.app`.
- macOS packaged app does not prompt: ensure you are running `dist/TFLiteTraining.app` (permissions are recorded per app bundle, not per terminal).
- Windows missing DLL: install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015–2022 (x64).
